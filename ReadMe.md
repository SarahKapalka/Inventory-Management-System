This is a project to be done by Sarah Kapalka, Omar Keita and Ebrima C Jalloh
Our aim is to develop a desktop app that will manage the inventory of local businesses in The Gambia

(Must have Node.js installed)

HOW TO TEST
To test the app run in the terminal:
npm run watch

and open another terminal and enter:

npm start

Use ./src/js/index.css for styling
you can also change the file to index.sass 
sass is also set up 👍
Good Luck!!
